This file serves as a way to gather all the information I want to convey and how to organize it.

Topics
- Gell-Mann matrices
- Fundamental and conjugate representation
- Labelling respresentations as (n,m)
    - tensoring n copies of 3-dim representation with m copies of conjugate representaiton
- Three dimension vector space with (1,0,0) being up quark, (0,1,0) begin down, (0,0,1) being strange
    - Approximate flavor symmetry and what that means
    - Flavor rotation
- Casimirs labelling the different irreps
- Complete set of commuting operators for the uncoupled and coupled basis
- Tensor product notation w/ up and down indices
- Hexagon Plots being plotted vs Y and vs S and what the diagonals represent in those plots
    - Anti-particle pairs being at opposite ends
- SU(2) subgroups and forming ladder operators to find fundamental and conjugate respresentations
- "Standard basis" being what we called the T generators rather than the Gell-Mann matrices themselves and why we use those
- Weight states and what weight generally means
- Tensor products add as vectors in weight space
- Hexagon plots being motivation for using SU(3)
- Action of each ladder operator in the hexagon plots (weight plot?)
- Why middle state isn't unique
- Why we don't get infinite number of states (i.e. ladder operators give 0 at some point)
- Electric charge from hypercharge
